# SnippetStash
A collection of small, reusable scripts (.bat, .py, etc.) to streamline everyday workflows. Little code, big help!

## Purpose
This repository is a stash of handy utilities I’ve created or collected to make repetitive tasks easier. Whether it’s generating a folder tree or cleaning up files, these snippets are designed to save time and effort.

## Snippets
Here’s what’s inside (so far):

- **batch/folder-tree.bat**  
  - *What it does*: Outputs a directory tree to a text file.  
  - *How to use*: Run it in a command prompt in the desired folder (`folder-tree.bat`), check `output.txt`.

*(More snippets will be added as you share them—let me know what else to include!)*

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the folder with the script you want (e.g., `batch/` or `python/`).
3. Follow the specific instructions in the snippet’s section above.
4. Run it—most scripts are self-contained and ready to go!

## Requirements
- **Batch (.bat)**: Windows OS with Command Prompt.
- **Python (.py)**: Python 3.x installed (if applicable—add versions as needed).
